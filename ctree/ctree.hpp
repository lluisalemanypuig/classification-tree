/**
 * @brief The Classification Tree class.
 *
 * This class helps manage the classification of objects via hand-crafted
 * key values \f$k_1, \dots, k_n\f$. At every node of the tree is stored
 * an array of pairs of (key, subtree). At depth level \f$i\f$ of the
 * tree, the key values in the pairs correspond to \f$k_i\f$.
 *
 * Now, for any two objects \f$p, q\f$,
 * - if \f$p \cong q\f$ then we must have \f$k_1(p) = k_1(q), \dots, k_n(p) = k_n(q)\f$.
 * The key values should be the same (first with first, second with second, ...)
 * for every element in a group of equal objects.
 * - if \f$k_i(p) \neq k_i(q)\f$ for any key function \f$k_i\f$ then we
 * must have \f$p \ncong q\f$.
 * - the fact that \f$k_1(p) = k_1(q), \dots, k_n(p) = k_n(q)\f$ does
 * not necessarily imply that \f$p \cong q\f$.
 *
 * At every call to the @ref add function with a new value, users can
 * provide some metadata associated to the new value. The object can be
 * added in two ways:
 * - Keep only unique instances. If the new value already exists in the
 * structure, the metadata provided is merged with the metadata of its
 * corresponding representative via the '+=' operator. In this case,
 * @e data_t is a type that must be Comparable via either the '==' operator
 * (see concept @ref EqualityComparable) or the '<' operator (see concept
 * @ref LessthanComparable) and the '==' operator (see concept
 * @ref EqualityComparable). Lastly, and @e metadata_t is a type that
 * implements the += operator (see concept @ref Incrementable).
 * - Keep all objects. Store the new object at the corresponding leaf of
 * the tree ignoring possible repeats.
 *
 * @tparam data_t Type of the values to store uniquely.
 * @tparam metadata_ Type of the metadata object associated to every unique
 * value.
 * @tparam keys_t The types of the values returned by the key functions.
